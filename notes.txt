Creation UI
- show saving indicator
- disable form submission on submit (in case it take a bit of time for db to save)
- form validation, front and back
- photos?
- markdown, to support italics, bold?
-- w a little hint button on how to use

- Have "stub" and "full recipe" tabs. Stub is a link to, say, an offline recipe in Joy

Display
- If missing fields, how show?
- Have an "edit" mode, not just contenteditabe?
- source: if url, link?
- Bottom of display page needs padding
- Fix spacing between rows
- Maybe fix display to support markdown instead of using pre?


Deployment
- Seems set up for single machine running all docker images - how to set up for distributed? Eg,
 different services on diff machines
- Envars and defaults are copied in each service. Seems hard to maintain.  Maybe a make file that
  sources a single list of envars and then builds images?


Maintainance (things needed to be a real project)
- Deployed and used by at least one user
- Creation of a roadmap
- Tests
- Docs
- Readme


Future Features
- Something lighter than angular?
- Drop NPM/Grunt in favor of makefiles?
- Meal scheduler, w integration to google calendar? Or at least export in ical format
- Easy export of recipes, in various formats
- Easy import of a recipe export
- Auto-adding recipes from foreign urls?
